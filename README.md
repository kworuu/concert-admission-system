# CONCERT ADMISSION SYSTEM

## Project Overview

The **Concert Ticket System** is a Java-based application designed to manage ticket sales for _concerts with multiple seating tiers_. Users can purchase tickets (could also be multiple tickets), select their desired seat, and view ticket details. The system is designed using **using object-oriented programming principles** (OOP) and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.

This system models real-world concert operations, including:

- Customers buying tickets
- Different seating tiers (VIP, General Admission, VVIP)
- Seat assignments
- Concert details (artist, venue, date)

## Entities and Classes

### Customer
